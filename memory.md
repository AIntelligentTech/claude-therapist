## Client Overview

- **Key Relationships**: Parents (living with), no current partner. Ex-partner of 10 years left in April 2024
- **Work/Study Context**: Not yet detailed; financial constraints mentioned (too broke to go out when distressed)
- **Location**: Glossop area, Derbyshire, UK (GP: Manor House Surgery, Derby & Derbyshire ICB)

### Presenting Concerns (Current Focus)
1. **Untreated ADHD with medication access crisis** - Had non-prescribed ADHD meds that transformed his life for 2 months; stopped for 2 weeks and crashed into depression. Cannot reliably re-access those meds. Awaiting Atrom Mindcare NHS Right to Choose diagnosis/treatment (status: waiting on response as of Dec 2025). Currently self-medicating with 400-900mg caffeine daily with limited effectiveness - still falling asleep mid-day.
2. **Major depression with previous suicidal ideation** - Several months ago had thoughts of self-harm. Crisis episode on Christmas Eve 2025 (walking alone until 4:30am, unable to stay home or afford to go out). Not currently suicidal but in severe distress.
3. **Complex grief and betrayal trauma from relationship breakdown** - Partner of 10 years (lived together since age 17, at parents' house) was having 6-10 year affair via online game (Final Fantasy XIV) with man from Texas. Discovered April 2024, kicked her out. She disappeared with single sentence: "I know you'll never forgive me, the next time you'll see me is to pick up my stuff". Still sleeping in the same room they shared for 10 years - daily re-traumatization.

## Therapeutic Progress

### Key Themes & Patterns Identified
- Three crises are deeply interlocked: untreated ADHD makes depression unbearable, trauma space prevents staying home when distressed, financial constraints prevent leaving
- Sleeping in trauma space (same room as 10-year relationship) is actively re-wounding daily
- Tony is highly researched and evidence-responsive (thorough ADHD research files demonstrate this)
- Responds well to clear explanation of medical/neurological aspects
- Intelligent, self-aware, able to articulate what's happening even in crisis
- Good judgment (recognized black market drugs as high-risk option)

### Insights & Breakthroughs
- Recognition that ADHD medication is medical necessity, not optional
- Understanding that the three crises amplify each other in feedback loop
- Recognition that room change is active trauma intervention, not "soft"

### Goals & Values
- Get proper ADHD diagnosis and medication (Atrom Mindcare pathway)
- Stabilize mental health
- Process relationship trauma when stable enough
- (Further values exploration needed in future sessions)

### Areas of Growth
- Sought help on Christmas Day despite crisis (shows motivation and insight)
- Willing to share parent letter to get support
- Open to making environmental changes (room)

## Session Log

### December 25, 2025 - First Session / Crisis Presentation

**Duration**: Extended session (first intake)

**Primary focus**: Crisis episode on Christmas Eve (walked alone until 4:30am); untreated ADHD and depression; relationship trauma aftermath; financial constraints

**Emotional state**: Distressed, in crisis, but coherent and reflective. No current suicidal ideation but history of it. Carrying weight of betrayal, loss, and neurological symptoms.

**Key discussion points**:
- April 2024 discovery of 6-10 year online affair; partner disappeared after 10 years together
- ADHD medication (non-prescribed) transformed life for 2 months; crash after 2-week withdrawal
- Cannot reliably re-access meds; black market amphetamines not viable option (client aware of risks)
- 400-900mg daily caffeine ineffective, still falling asleep mid-day
- Waiting on Atrom Mindcare response (NHS Right to Choose pathway)
- Still sleeping in room shared with ex for 10 years - source of daily re-traumatization
- Financial constraints prevent him from leaving house when in distress
- Christmas Eve crisis: couldn't stay home, couldn't afford to go anywhere, walked village until 4:30am

**Interventions used**:
- Validation of crisis severity
- Psychoeducation on ADHD-depression-trauma interaction (the "three crises" model)
- Normalization of trauma response to betrayal and abandonment
- Direct clarification that this is a medical emergency, not personal failure
- Crisis resource provision (Samaritans 116 123, Crisis Text SHOUT to 85258)
