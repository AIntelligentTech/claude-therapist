> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: Developing psychological flexibility to live a rich, meaningful life.

---

## Core Model: The Hexaflex

Psychological flexibility is the ability to be present, open up, and do what matters.

```
                    PRESENT MOMENT
                         ↑
           ACCEPTANCE ←—— ——→ DEFUSION
                    ↘       ↙
              PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY
                    ↗       ↖
       SELF-AS-CONTEXT ←—— ——→ VALUES
                         ↓
                  COMMITTED ACTION
```

**Six Core Processes**:
1. **Acceptance**: Willingness to experience internal events
2. **Defusion**: Creating distance from thoughts
3. **Present Moment**: Contact with here-and-now
4. **Self-as-Context**: The observing self
5. **Values**: What matters most
6. **Committed Action**: Behavioral steps toward values

## 1. Acceptance (vs. Experiential Avoidance)

### Core Concept
Willingness to have difficult internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories) without trying to control, avoid, or eliminate them.

### Key Distinction
- **Acceptance ≠ Approval**: You don't have to like it
- **Acceptance ≠ Resignation**: You're not giving up
- **Acceptance = Making room**: Allowing experience to be present

### Techniques

**Expansion (Opening Up)**
1. Notice where you feel the emotion in your body
2. Observe it with curiosity (size, shape, color, temperature)
3. Breathe into and around it
4. Make room for it, let it be there
5. Notice you are larger than this feeling

**Willingness Scale**
"On a scale of 0-10, how willing are you to have this difficult feeling in service of what matters to you?"

**The Struggle Switch**
- Imagine emotions connected to a struggle switch
- When switched ON: Fighting emotions creates more distress
- When switched OFF: Allowing emotions to flow through

**"And" Practice**
- "I feel anxious AND I'm going to this meeting"
- "I'm afraid AND I'm doing it anyway"

---

## 2. Defusion (vs. Cognitive Fusion)

### Core Concept
Creating distance between yourself and your thoughts so they have less control over behavior. Seeing thoughts as thoughts, not as reality.

### Key Insight
- We don't need to change, challenge, or eliminate thoughts
- We change our RELATIONSHIP to thoughts
- Thoughts are just mental events, not commands

### Techniques

**Verbal Defusion**
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- "My mind is telling me..."
- "There's that old story again"
- "Thanks, mind, for that thought"

**Name the Story**
- "Ah, there's the 'I'm not good enough' story"
- "Here comes the 'something terrible will happen' narrative"

**Silly Voice**
- Say the thought in a cartoon voice
- Sing it to "Happy Birthday"
- Say it very slowly or very fast

**Physicalization**
- If this thought were an object, what would it look like?
- What color? Size? Texture? Weight?
- Where would you put it?

**Leaves on a Stream**
1. Imagine sitting by a stream with leaves floating by
2. Place each thought on a leaf
3. Watch it float downstream
4. Don't try to speed them up or slow them down
5. If you get hooked, notice and return to observing

**Passengers on the Bus**
- You're the driver of a bus
- Passengers are your thoughts, feelings, memories
- Scary passengers threaten you if you don't go their way
- You can let them stay on the bus AND drive where YOU want to go

**The Mind as a Radio**
- Mind is like "Radio Doom FM"
- Always broadcasting negative news
- You don't have to turn it off—just notice it's playing
- You don't have to believe everything it says

---

## 3. Present Moment (Contact with Now)

### Core Concept
Flexible attention to what's happening here and now, rather than being lost in past or future.

### Techniques

**Noticing Exercise**
- What are you seeing right now?
- What sounds are present?
- What sensations in your body?
- What's your mind doing?

**Five Senses Grounding**
- 5 things you see
- 4 things you hear
- 3 things you feel (physical)
- 2 things you smell
- 1 thing you taste

**Breath as Anchor**
- Notice breath without changing it
- Where do you feel it most?
- Let breath be home base

**Dropping Anchor**
1. **A**cknowledge: What's showing up inside?
2. **C**onnect: With your body, breath, ground
3. **E**ngage: In what you're doing, refocus attention

---

## 4. Self-as-Context (The Observing Self)

### Core Concept
The "I" that notices all experience but is not defined by it. The continuous perspective from which you observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations.

### Key Insight
- You have thoughts, but you are not your thoughts
- You have feelings, but you are not your feelings
- You have a story, but you are not your story
- There's a YOU that has been present through all experiences

### Techniques

**The Chessboard Metaphor**
- Thoughts and feelings are chess pieces (black and white)
- They battle each other endlessly
- You are the BOARD, not the pieces
- The board holds all pieces without being affected

**Sky and Weather**
- Thoughts and feelings are like weather—constantly changing
- You are the sky—always present, containing all weather
- Storms come and go; the sky remains

**Observer Exercise**
1. Notice your thoughts... and notice you are the one noticing
2. Notice your feelings... and notice you are the one noticing
3. Notice your body sensations... and notice you are the one noticing
4. What is it that notices all these things?

**Continuous You**
- This observing self has been with you your whole life
- Same "you" at 5 years old as now
- Same "you" in best and worst moments
- A safe, unchanging vantage point

---

## 5. Values (What Matters)

### Core Concept
Chosen directions in life—what you want to stand for, how you want to behave, what kind of person you want to be. Values are ongoing directions, not goals.

### Values vs. Goals
- **Values**: Ongoing directions (like "west")
- **Goals**: Achievable milestones along the way (like "reach the beach")
- You never "achieve" a value—you live it moment to moment

### Techniques

**Values Clarification Questions**
- What do you want your life to stand for?
- If you could be remembered for three things, what would they be?
- What would you do if fear wasn't in the way?
- On your deathbed, what would you regret not doing?
- When you feel most alive, what are you doing?

**Life Domains Assessment**
Rate importance (1-10) and current alignment (1-10) for:
- Relationships (partner, family, friends)
- Work/career
- Health/body
- Personal growth/learning
- Recreation/fun
- Spirituality/meaning
- Community/contribution
- Environment/nature

**The Eulogy Exercise**
Imagine your 80th birthday or funeral:
- What would you want people to say about you?
- How did you treat others?
- What did you stand for?
- What difference did you make?

**Values Card Sort**
From a list of values, identify:
- Top 5 most important to you
- Which you're currently living
- Which feel neglected

**Sweet Spot**
When does time fly? When do you feel most "you"? That often points to values.

---

## 6. Committed Action

### Core Concept
Taking effective action guided by values, even when difficult internal experiences show up. Behavioral steps toward a meaningful life.

### Techniques

**The Choice Point**

```
        Toward Valued Life (what matters)
                    ↑
     CHOICE POINT ← Difficult Thoughts/Feelings
                    ↓
        Away Moves (avoidance, struggle)
```

At any moment, we can move TOWARD or AWAY from values.

**SMART Values-Based Goals**
- **S**pecific: What exactly will you do?
- **M**eaningful: Connected to which value?
- **A**daptive: Will it improve your life?
- **R**ealistic: Can you actually do it?
- **T**ime-framed: When will you do it?

**Smallest Possible Step**
- What's the tiniest step toward this value?
- Too big = avoidance; too small = procrastination
- Find the "just right" next action

**Willingness + Action**
- "I'm willing to feel [difficult emotion] in order to [valued action]"
- Expand around discomfort while moving forward

**Commitment Strategies**
- Tell someone your intention
- Schedule specific time
- Create environmental supports
- Link new behavior to existing habits
- Celebrate small wins
