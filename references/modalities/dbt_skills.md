## Module 3: Emotion Regulation

### Understanding Emotions

**Model of Emotions**:
```
Prompting Event → Interpretation → Emotional Response → Expression/Action
                                   ↓
                        Vulnerability Factors
```

**Functions of Emotions**:
1. Communicate to others (facial expressions, body language)
2. Motivate action (approach/avoid)
3. Communicate to ourselves (something needs attention)

### Reducing Vulnerability

**PLEASE** (Physical Vulnerability Factors)
- **P**hysical illness: Treat it, see doctor
- **L**earn to eat in a balanced way: Regular meals, adequate nutrition
- **E**xercise regularly: Movement that feels good
- **A**void mood-altering substances: Limit/eliminate alcohol, drugs
- **S**leep: Consistent schedule, adequate rest
- **E**njoy pleasant activities: Build mastery and positive experiences

**ABC PLEASE** (Full Protocol)
- **A**ccumulate positive experiences (short and long-term)
- **B**uild mastery (do things that make you feel competent)
- **C**ope ahead (prepare for difficult situations)
- Plus PLEASE skills above

### Changing Emotions

**Check the Facts**
1. What is the emotion I want to change?
2. What is the prompting event?
3. What are my interpretations/assumptions?
4. Am I assuming a threat? What's the real threat?
5. What's the catastrophe? How likely is it?
6. Does my emotion fit the facts?

**Opposite Action**
When emotion doesn't fit the facts or acting on it is ineffective:

| Emotion | Action Urge | Opposite Action |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fear | Avoid | Approach, do what you're afraid of |
| Anger | Attack | Gently avoid, do something kind |
| Sadness | Withdraw | Get active, approach others |
| Shame | Hide | Share with safe person, hold head high |
| Guilt | Punish self | Repair, make amends, let go |

**Problem Solving**
When emotion fits the facts and the situation can be changed:
1. Describe the problem (check the facts)
2. Identify goal
3. Brainstorm solutions
4. Choose solution
5. Put solution into action
6. Evaluate results

### DEAR MAN (Getting What You Want)

- **D**escribe: State the facts objectively, no judgments
- **E**xpress: Share your feelings with "I" statements

- **R**einforce: Explain positive consequences of getting your need met

- **M**indful: Stay focused, broken record if needed, ignore attacks
- **A**ppear confident: Eye contact, posture, tone, even if you don't feel it
- **N**egotiate: Be willing to give to get, offer alternatives

- **I**nterested: Listen, don't interrupt, be curious

- **S**tick to values: Don't compromise what matters to you
- **T**ruthful: No exaggeration, no lying, be honest

### Factors to Consider

**Priorities in any situation**:
1. **Objective**: How important is getting what I want?
2. **Relationship**: How important is this relationship?
3. **Self-respect**: How important is maintaining my self-respect?

Adjust intensity based on priorities (use DEAR MAN fully vs. partially).

## Walking the Middle Path

### Dialectical Thinking

### Validation Levels (Linehan)
1. **Pay attention**: Be present, listen
