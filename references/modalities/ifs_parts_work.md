# IFS Parts Work Reference

> Internal Family Systems: Understanding and harmonizing the internal system of parts.

---

## Core Model

### The Multiplicity of Mind
Everyone has multiple "parts" or subpersonalities. This is normal, not pathological. When parts are in harmony with Self-leadership, there is wellbeing.

### Three Types of Parts

**1. Exiles**
- Young, wounded parts carrying pain from past
- Hold burdens of trauma, shame, fear, worthlessness
- Locked away to protect the system
- Want to be witnessed, loved, and unburdened

**2. Managers**
- Proactive protectors
- Try to prevent exile pain from being triggered
- Control, perfectionism, caretaking, intellectualizing
- "Stay in control so nothing bad happens"

**3. Firefighters**
- Reactive protectors
- Act when exiles get triggered despite managers
- Impulsive, extreme measures to numb or distract
- Substances, self-harm, binging, rage, dissociation
- "Put out the fire NOW by any means"

### The Self
The core, undamaged essence of a person. Not a part—the ground of being from which we can lead our internal system.

**The 8 C's of Self-Energy**:
1. **Curiosity**: Genuine interest without agenda
2. **Calm**: Groundedness even with intense content
3. **Clarity**: Clear perception undistorted by parts
4. **Compassion**: Caring without caretaking
5. **Confidence**: Trust in the process
6. **Courage**: Willingness to face what's difficult
7. **Creativity**: Flexible, spontaneous responses
8. **Connectedness**: Sense of being part of something larger

**The 5 P's of Self-Energy**:
- Patience
- Presence
- Perspective
- Persistence
- Playfulness

## Working with Parts

### Step 1: Identify the Part
- "There's a part of me that..."
- Notice where you feel it in your body
- What does it look like? Age? Posture?

### Step 2: Separate from the Part (Unblending)
**Signs of Blending**:
- "I AM angry" (vs. "I notice anger")
- Overwhelmed by the feeling
- Speaking AS the part, not ABOUT it
- Black-and-white thinking
- Urgency, reactivity

**Unblending Questions**:
- "Can you sense how much you ARE this feeling vs. just noticing it?"
- "Would this part be willing to step back just a bit?"
- "Can you find even a tiny bit of space between you and this part?"
- "Ask the part if it would give you just a little room"

### Step 3: How Do You Feel TOWARD This Part?
- Curiosity = Self-energy, good to proceed
- Annoyance/judgment = another part is present (a protector)
- Fear/overwhelm = need more separation

If another part is blocking:
- "What's concerned about getting to know this part?"
- Work with the concerned part first

### Step 4: Learn About the Part
**Exploratory Questions**:
- What does this part want me to know?
- What is it afraid would happen if it stopped doing its job?
- How old is it? How long has it been doing this?
- What does it need from me?
- What does it really want (positive intention)?

### Step 5: Address Fears and Burdens
For protectors:
- Appreciate their efforts
- Help them see the exile is now safer
- Negotiate new roles

For exiles:
- Witness their story
- Offer compassion from Self
- Reparent/meet unmet needs
- Unburden (release carried emotions/beliefs)

## Common Protector Parts

| Part | Typical Behavior | Fear/Belief | What It Needs |
|------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Inner Critic** | Harsh self-judgment | "If I criticize first, others can't hurt me" | To know you're safe now |
| **Perfectionist** | Never good enough | "Mistakes mean rejection" | Permission to be human |
| **People Pleaser** | Prioritizes others | "My needs don't matter" | Validation of self-worth |
| **Controller** | Micromanages | "If I don't control, chaos" | Trust in Self-leadership |
| **Achiever** | Constant striving | "Worth = accomplishment" | Unconditional acceptance |
| **Caretaker** | Over-gives | "I exist to serve others" | Permission for self-care |
| **Avoider** | Procrastinates, numbs | "If I engage, I'll be overwhelmed" | Safety and capacity |
| **Anxious Part** | Worries constantly | "Something bad will happen" | Reassurance and presence |

## Common Exile Burdens

**Emotional Burdens**:
- Shame ("I am bad/defective")
- Worthlessness ("I don't matter")
- Fear ("The world is dangerous")
- Grief ("I lost something vital")
- Loneliness ("I am alone")
- Helplessness ("I can't cope")

**Cognitive Burdens** (Extreme Beliefs):
- "I'm unlovable"
- "I'm stupid"
- "I'll always be abandoned"
- "I have to be perfect to be accepted"
- "My needs are too much"

## The Unburdening Process

### For Exiles (After Sufficient Witnessing)

1. **Witness the Pain**
   - Let the exile show you what happened
   - Be present with Self-compassion
   - Validate the experience

2. **Retrieve from the Past**
   - Bring the exile into the present
   - Help it realize the past is over
   - "Would it like to come be with me now?"

3. **Unburden**
   - "What did this part have to take on that doesn't belong to it?"
   - Invite the part to release the burden
   - To light, water, earth, fire, or wind
   - Notice what replaces the burden

4. **Invite New Qualities**
   - Ask the unburdened part what qualities it wants
   - Love, confidence, peace, freedom, etc.
   - Invite these qualities in

### For Protectors

1. **Appreciate their work**
   - They've been working hard to protect

2. **Check their fears**
   - What are they afraid would happen if they relaxed?

3. **Update their information**
   - Help them see the present is different from the past
   - Exiles can be healed

4. **Negotiate new roles**
   - "If you didn't have to do this job, what would you like to do?"
   - Protectors often want to play, create, relax

## IFS Questions Quick Reference

### Accessing Parts
- "What part of you is activated right now?"
- "When you think about X, what comes up inside?"
- "Where do you notice that in your body?"

### Checking for Self
- "How do you feel toward this part right now?"
- Curiosity = Self is present
- Any negative feeling = another part

### Getting to Know Parts
- "What does this part want you to know?"
- "What is it trying to protect you from?"
- "What would happen if it stopped doing its job?"
- "How long has it been doing this?"
- "How old does it feel?"

### Negotiating with Protectors
- "Would it be willing to step back just a bit?"
- "What does it need to feel safe enough to relax?"
- "Can you appreciate what it's been trying to do for you?"

### Working with Exiles
- "What does this young part need?"
- "What did it never get to experience?"
- "Would it like you to be with it now?"
- "Can you offer it what it needed back then?"

## Self-Leadership in Daily Life

### When a Part Gets Triggered
1. Notice: "A part of me is activated"
2. Pause: Don't act from the part
3. Acknowledge: "I see you, I know you're trying to help"
4. Inquire: "What do you need right now?"
5. Respond from Self: With one of the 8 C's

### Building Self-Trust
- Keep promises to yourself
- Follow through on small commitments
- Listen to parts without judging
- Take action from Self, not parts

### Daily Check-In
- How am I feeling right now?
- What parts are present?
- What do they need?
- What would Self do next?

## Common Polarizations

Parts often become polarized—locked in opposition:

| One Part Says | Polarized Part Says |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Work harder!" | "I need rest!" |
| "Stay safe, don't risk" | "Go for it, take chances" |
| "Express yourself!" | "Keep quiet, blend in" |
| "Be independent" | "I need connection" |

**Working with Polarizations**:
1. Identify both parts
2. Talk to each separately
3. Help each understand the other's positive intention
4. Find what they both want at the deepest level
5. Help them collaborate rather than fight

## Integration with Other Approaches

**With CBT/ACT**:
- Defusion = creating space from parts
- Cognitive distortions often come from specific parts
- Values clarification helps Self set direction

**With Trauma Work**:
- Stabilization = strengthening Self-leadership
- Protectors need to trust before exile work
- Go slowly, respect protectors' pace

**With Somatic Approaches**:
- Parts often hold body sensations
- Somatic experiencing of parts accelerates work
- Body as map to parts
