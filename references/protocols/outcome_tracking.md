# Outcome Tracking Protocol

> Measurement-based care approaches for monitoring therapeutic progress.

## Why Track Outcomes

### Benefits of Measurement-Based Care

**For Client**:
- Objective view of progress
- Validates that therapy is working (or flags when it isn't)
- Identifies patterns
- Empowers informed participation
- Can motivate during difficult phases

**For Therapy**:
- Early detection of non-response
- Guides treatment decisions
- Facilitates honest conversations
- Tracks what works/doesn't
- Improves overall effectiveness

### Research Support

- Clients whose therapists use routine outcome monitoring have better outcomes
- Early warning of non-response prevents deterioration
- Feedback-informed treatment is evidence-based practice

## Simple Outcome Measures

### Overall Wellbeing (Weekly)

**Single-Item Rating**:
"On a scale of 0-10, how would you rate your overall wellbeing this past week?"

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 0-2 | Severe distress, barely functioning |
| 3-4 | Significant struggles, functioning impaired |
| 5-6 | Mixed, some good and bad |
| 7-8 | Mostly good, occasional difficulties |
| 9-10 | Excellent, thriving |

**Track over time to see trajectory.**

### Depression Screening (PHQ-2 Quick)

Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you:

1. Had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
2. Felt down, depressed, or hopeless?

| Score | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Not at all |
| 1 | Several days |
| 2 | More than half the days |
| 3 | Nearly every day |

**Total 0-6**: 3+ suggests depression, warrants full assessment

### Anxiety Screening (GAD-2 Quick)

Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you:

1. Felt nervous, anxious, or on edge?
2. Been unable to stop or control worrying?

**Same scoring as PHQ-2**
**Total 0-6**: 3+ suggests anxiety, warrants full assessment

## Session-by-Session Tracking

### Session Rating Scale (SRS) - Alliance Check

At end of each session, rate 0-10:

1. **Relationship**: "I felt heard, understood, and respected today"
2. **Goals/Topics**: "We worked on what I wanted to work on"
3. **Approach**: "The approach we're using fits for me"
4. **Overall**: "Overall, this was a good session for me"

**Low scores** (below 7 on any item): Explore and address directly

### Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) - Wellbeing Check

At start of each session, rate 0-10:

1. **Individual**: "How are you doing personally?"
2. **Interpersonal**: "How are your relationships going?"
3. **Social**: "How are things at work/school/life roles?"
4. **Overall**: "Overall, how would you rate your week?"

**Total 0-40**: Below 25 suggests clinical distress

## What to Track and When

### Every Session
- Opening wellbeing check (ORS or simple 0-10)
- Session quality (SRS at end)
- Alliance observations

### Weekly
- Symptom severity (relevant measures)
- Homework completion
- Crisis/safety status

### Monthly
- Full PHQ-9/GAD-7 or relevant measures
- Goal progress review
- Life domain functioning
- Treatment satisfaction

### Periodically (Every 4-6 sessions)
- Comprehensive review of all trends
- Treatment response discussion
- Goal adjustment if needed
- Alliance check (explicit)

---

## Interpreting Patterns

### Positive Signs
- Consistent improvement over time
- Symptom scores decreasing
- Functioning scores increasing
- Client reports feeling better
- Alliance ratings high

### Concerning Patterns

**Flat line (no change)**:
- After 4-6 sessions, should see some movement
- Discuss openly: "I notice we've been at the same level..."
- Consider: Right approach? Right goals? Barriers?

**Deterioration**:
- Scores getting worse over time
- Don't ignore—address directly
- Consider: External stressors? Alliance issue? Wrong treatment?

**Inconsistency (up and down)**:
- May be normal oscillation
- Look for patterns (what weeks are better?)
- Explore triggers and buffers

**Alliance drops**:
- Take seriously—address next session
- "Last time your rating was lower—can we talk about that?"
- Rupture-repair opportunity

---

## Non-Response Protocol

### When to Consider Non-Response

**Definition**: No clinically significant improvement after adequate trial

**Markers**:
- Less than 50% symptom reduction after 8+ sessions
- Flat symptom trajectory for 4+ sessions
- Client reports not feeling helped
- Low alliance ratings persist

### Non-Response Conversation

**Approach**:
1. Name the pattern openly (without blame)
2. Explore client's perspective
3. Consider all factors (external, internal, treatment, alliance)
4. Collaboratively decide next steps

**Script**:
"I've been tracking our progress, and I notice we've been at [level] for a while now. I want to make sure we're doing what's most helpful for you. Can we talk about what you're noticing? Is this approach feeling right? Are there barriers we haven't addressed?"

### Options When Not Progressing

1. **Adjust approach within therapy**
   - Different techniques
   - Different focus
   - More/less structure

2. **Address barriers**
   - External stressors
   - Practical obstacles
   - Ambivalence about change

3. **Explore alliance issues**
   - Unspoken ruptures
   - Mismatch in approach
   - Trust issues

4. **Consider additional support**
   - Medication evaluation
   - Group therapy
   - Specialized treatment
   - Higher level of care

## Discussing Measures with Clients

### Framing

"I like to check in regularly on how things are going—not just in our conversations, but with some structured questions too. It helps us track progress and make sure therapy is working for you. Think of it like a compass—it helps us know if we're heading in the right direction."

### Addressing Concerns

**"Will you judge me based on numbers?"**
"These aren't tests to pass or fail. They're just information to help us both understand how things are going. Low scores aren't bad—they tell us where to focus."

**"I don't want to reduce my feelings to numbers"**
"The numbers are just one data point. Your experience and words matter most. The numbers help spot patterns we might miss otherwise."

### Celebrating Progress

When scores improve:
- Name it explicitly
- Explore what contributed
- Reinforce client's role in change
- Document what worked

## Quick Reference: When to Ask What

| Timing | Measure | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Session start | ORS or simple 0-10 | Track week-to-week wellbeing |
| Session end | SRS or alliance check | Monitor therapeutic relationship |
| Monthly | PHQ-9, GAD-7 | Track symptom severity trends |
| Every 4-6 sessions | Comprehensive review | Assess overall treatment response |
| As needed | Goal-specific measures | Track particular treatment targets |

*Measurement is in service of the relationship, not a replacement for it. Use data to enhance clinical conversations, not substitute for them.*
