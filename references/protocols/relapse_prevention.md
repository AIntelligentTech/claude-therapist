## Understanding Relapse

### What Is Relapse?

Relapse is a return to previous patterns of symptoms, behaviors, or functioning after a period of improvement. It's a process, not an event.

### Lapse vs. Relapse

| Lapse | Relapse |
|-------|---------|
| Single slip or setback | Sustained return to old patterns |
| Brief, contained | Extended, escalating |
| Can be recovered from quickly | Requires renewed intervention |
| Part of normal recovery | May require returning to earlier treatment phase |

**Key principle**: A lapse doesn't have to become a relapse. How you respond to a lapse matters more than the lapse itself.

### The Relapse Process

Relapse typically unfolds in stages:

1. **Emotional relapse**: Internal warning signs (isolation, anxiety, poor self-care)
2. **Mental relapse**: Cognitive signs (thinking about old patterns, romanticizing, planning)
3. **Behavioral relapse**: Return to problematic behaviors or symptoms

Early intervention at emotional/mental stages prevents behavioral relapse.

## Cognitive Strategies

### Challenging Relapse-Related Thoughts

**Common relapse thoughts**:
- "I've blown it, might as well give up"
- "One time won't hurt"
- "I can handle it now"
- "Things are different, I don't need [strategies]"
- "I'm cured, I don't need to be careful"

**Reality checks**:
- One slip doesn't erase progress
- Vulnerability may be lifelong (this is okay)
- Maintenance is strength, not weakness
- Warning signs deserve attention
- Overconfidence is itself a warning sign

### The Decision Matrix

When tempted to abandon maintenance strategies:

|  | Short-term | Long-term |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| **If I maintain my plan** | May feel restrictive, effortful | Continued wellbeing, growth |
| **If I abandon my plan** | May feel free, relieved | Risk of relapse, regression |
