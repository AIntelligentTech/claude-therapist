## Purpose of Values Work

### Why Values Matter in Therapy

**Values provide**:
- Direction when you're lost
- Motivation when willpower fails
- Meaning when things are hard
- Criteria for decisions
- Framework for identity
- Compass for recovery

**Values work is essential when**:
- Feeling stuck or directionless
- Depression has flattened motivation
- Making major life decisions
- Rebuilding after loss/trauma
- Identity confusion
- Behavioral change is needed

## Values vs. Goals

| Values | Goals |
|--------|-------|
| Directions (like "west") | Destinations (like "the beach") |
| Ongoing, never completed | Achievable, can be checked off |
| How you want to BE | What you want to DO |
| Intrinsic motivation | Extrinsic markers |
| Process-focused | Outcome-focused |

**Example**:
- Value: Being a loving parent
- Goals: Spend 1 hour of quality time daily, attend school events, listen without judgment

Values guide goal selection. Goals serve values.

## Life Domains Assessment

### The Domains

Rate each on:
- **Importance** (0-10): How much does this matter to you?
- **Current Alignment** (0-10): How aligned is your life with this value right now?

| Domain | Importance | Alignment | Gap |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Family relationships** | | | |
| **Romantic relationship/intimacy** | | | |
| **Friendships/social life** | | | |
| **Work/career** | | | |
| **Education/learning** | | | |
| **Recreation/fun/hobbies** | | | |
| **Health/body/self-care** | | | |
| **Spirituality/meaning** | | | |
| **Community/contribution** | | | |
| **Environment/nature** | | | |
| **Creativity/self-expression** | | | |
| **Personal growth** | | | |

**Focus areas**: Where importance is high but alignment is low.

## Values Clarification Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Eulogy/80th Birthday

Imagine you're 80 (or at your funeral). People who matter to you are speaking.

**Questions**:
1. What do you want them to say about you?
2. How did you treat people?
3. What did you stand for?
4. What difference did you make?
5. What do you want to be remembered for?

**Write out short speeches from**:
- A family member
- A close friend
- A colleague
- Someone you helped

### Exercise 2: The Sweet Spot

Recall moments when you felt most:
- Alive
- Engaged
- Fulfilled
- Like yourself
- That time flew by

**For each moment, ask**:
- What was happening?
- What values were being expressed?
- Who was involved?
- What made it meaningful?

Look for patterns across moments.

### Exercise 3: Values Card Sort

**Full Values List** (select top 10, then narrow to top 5):

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authenticity | Adventure | Balance | Belonging |
| Challenge | Compassion | Connection | Contribution |
| Courage | Creativity | Curiosity | Dependability |
| Fairness | Faith | Family | Freedom |
| Friendship | Fun | Generosity | Growth |
| Health | Honesty | Humor | Independence |
| Integrity | Intimacy | Justice | Kindness |
| Knowledge | Leadership | Learning | Love |
| Loyalty | Meaning | Nature | Openness |
| Order | Passion | Patience | Peace |
| Persistence | Play | Power | Presence |
| Purpose | Respect | Responsibility | Security |
| Self-expression | Service | Simplicity | Spirituality |
| Stability | Success | Trust | Wisdom |

**Process**:
1. Scan list, note which resonate
2. Select top 10
3. Rank order
4. Identify top 5 core values
5. Define what each means TO YOU

### Exercise 4: What Would You Do If...

- Money were no object?
- You knew you couldn't fail?
- You had one year to live?
- No one was watching or judging?
- Fear wasn't in the way?

What do these answers tell you about your values?

### Exercise 5: Pain Points

- What makes you most angry when you see it in the world?
- What injustices bother you most?
- What do you criticize in others?

Often, strong negative reactions point to violated values. What you judge in others can reveal what you care about.

### Exercise 6: Flow Activities

List activities where you lose track of time (in a good way):
1.
2.
3.

For each: What values are being expressed or honored?

## Common Values Confusions

### Shoulds vs. Wants

**Shoulds** come from:
- Family expectations
- Cultural norms
- Past roles
- Other people's values
- Guilt and obligation

**Authentic values**:
- Feel energizing when engaged
- Are chosen, not imposed
- Persist across contexts
- You'd hold even if no one knew

**Test**: "If no one would ever know and no one would judge, would I still choose this?"

### Means vs. Ends

Sometimes what seems like a value is actually a strategy:

| Strategy (Means) | Value (End) |
|------------------|-------------|
| Making money | Security, freedom, providing for family |
| Being thin | Health, attractiveness, acceptance |
| Getting promoted | Achievement, contribution, status |
| Having many friends | Connection, belonging, fun |

Dig deeper: "What would that give me?" → "And what would THAT give me?"

### Past vs. Present Values

Values can change across life stages. What mattered at 20 may not at 40.

Check: Are these values current, or are you living by an outdated map?

---

## Values-Based Action Planning

### From Values to Behavior

For each core value, identify:

**Value**: [e.g., Connection]

**What this means to me**:
[Personal definition]

**Current alignment** (0-10): [X]

**Small actions that express this value**:
1. [Daily: Text a friend]
2. [Weekly: Have a real conversation]
3. [Monthly: Plan a get-together]

**Barriers to living this value**:
[What gets in the way?]

**Willing to feel ______ in service of this value?**
[What discomfort are you willing to have?]

### The Smallest Step

For each value gap identified:

- What's the tiniest step toward this value?
- Something you could do today?
- What would 1% more alignment look like?

Big changes come from consistent small actions.

### When Values Conflict

Sometimes values compete (e.g., family vs. career advancement).

**Resolution approaches**:
1. Are both truly YOUR values, or is one a "should"?
2. Can you find creative ways to honor both?
3. Which value is calling most loudly right now?
4. What would you regret NOT prioritizing?
5. Can you alternate focus over time?

## Values in Crisis/Depression

### When Nothing Feels Meaningful

Depression can flatten the sense of meaning. Values may feel:
- Abstract and distant
- Impossible to access
- Pointless

**Approach**:
- Don't force it—start with very small behavioral experiments
- Act "as if" the value matters, see what happens
- Look to the past—what DID matter?
- Borrow motivation from relationships (who would want this for you?)
- Start with survival values (self-care, basic functioning)

### Values as Anchor

When emotions are overwhelming:
- Values provide direction that doesn't depend on feeling good
- "I can feel terrible AND still move toward what matters"
- Committed action despite internal weather

## Session Integration

### For First Values Exploration
1. Introduce concept of values vs. goals
2. Use Life Domains Assessment for broad view
3. Pick 1-2 exercises that fit client
4. Identify 3-5 core values
5. Explore meaning of each

### For Ongoing Work
1. Check in: "How aligned has your week been?"
2. Celebrate values-based actions
3. Problem-solve barriers
4. Deepen understanding of values
5. Set values-based intentions

### For Crisis/Stuck Points
- Return to values as compass
- "What does [value] call you to do here?"
- Small values-aligned action as way through

---

## Values Tracking in Memory

### What to Record

In the client memory file, track:

**Core Values** (top 5):
1. [Value] - [brief definition] - [current alignment 0-10]
2. ...

**Values-Based Goals**:
- [Value]: [Specific action/goal] - [status]

**Values Conflicts**:
- [Competing values and how addressing]

**Values Growth**:
- [Changes in values understanding over time]

---

## Motivational Interviewing Integration

### Exploring Importance

- "On a scale of 0-10, how important is [value] to you?"
- "Why a [number] and not a 0?"
- "What would it take to move to a [higher number]?"

### Exploring Confidence

- "How confident are you that you could live by this value more?"
- "What would help increase your confidence?"

### Change Talk

Listen for and amplify:
- Desire: "I want to be more [value]"
- Ability: "I could start by..."
- Reasons: "It matters because..."
- Need: "I really need to..."
- Commitment: "I will..."

*Values work is not about finding the "right" values—it's about connecting with what genuinely matters to you and building a life that reflects that.*
